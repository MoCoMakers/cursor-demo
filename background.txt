# Step 1: Load historical price data
# For simplicity, we'll simulate it
np.random.seed(42)
days = 100
price = np.cumsum(np.random.normal(0, 1, days)) + 100
returns = np.diff(price)

# Step 2: Prepare data
X = np.arange(len(returns))  # time index
y = returns

# Step 3: Define Bayesian model
with pm.Model() as model:
    alpha = pm.Normal("alpha", mu=0, sigma=1)
    beta = pm.Normal("beta", mu=0, sigma=1)
    sigma = pm.HalfNormal("sigma", sigma=1)

    mu = alpha + beta * X

    # Step 4: Run MCMC sampling

# Step 5: Analyze results

- Bayesian inference: Updates beliefs about model parameters based on observed data
- MCMC sampling: Generates samples from the posterior distribution when it's analytically intractable
- Expected return: The mean of predicted future returns, used to guide buy/sell decisions
- Time series modeling: Treats asset returns as a function of time
- Alpha and beta: Regression coefficients representing intercept and trend
- Volatility (Ïƒ): Modeled as a random variable to capture uncertainty in returns
